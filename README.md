# mobilizing-million-hearts-app
The Mobilizing Million Hearts app is a SMART on FHIR application that includes two highly usable and supportive tools to address atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk at the point of care. These tools, the ASCVD Risk Estimator and Risk Educator are respectively provider- and patient-facing risk calculators that pull from existing data within the electronic health record to estimate an individualâ€™s chance of suffering a cardiovascular event over the course of ten years.
